# WIPs
__Witnet Improvement Proposals__ (WIPs) are documents proposing, specifying and standardizing new protocol features, processes and methods in the Witnet community.

People wishing to submit WIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the [Witnet community Discord][discord]. After discussion, please open a Pull Request to this repository. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

This repository is maintained by Witnet Foundation. We are fairly liberal with approving WIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception would be the very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a WIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
