## Abstract

This proposal suggests modifications to the coin issuance schedule and block time within the Witnet protocol.
The proposed changes aim to enhance network efficiency, sustainability, and incentivization, particularly in
anticipation of the transition to Proof of Stake in Wit/2.

The key adjustments include adjusting the block rewards, banning halvings and reducing the block time, aka _epoch 
period_.

## Motivation and rationale

### Current status and problem statement

At present, Witnet operates on a fixed block reward model introduced by [WIP-0003], where a constant amount of 250 
wit is newly _minted_ by miners on each block that gets appended to the chain. With a block time of 45 seconds, this 
amounts to a yearly issuance of more than 175 million Wit coins. As of the publication of this document, this 
translates to an annual inflation rate of approximately 13%.

A key feature in the current block reward model is _halvings_. Every 5 years since the inception of the Witnet mainnet,
block rewards are scheduled to go down by 50%. That is, rewards would go from 250 Wit a block down to 125 Wit in
October 2025, then to 62.5 in October 2030, and so on.

While the high inflation rate provided by this model has facilitated network operations and incentivized participation,
it is facing important challenges as the ecosystem evolves. Notably, the impending transition to Proof of Stake in 
Wit/2 calls for a reassessment of the coin issuance schedule to align with the new consensus algorithm.

Namely, the drastic reduction in block rewards over time due to halving events may lead to significant fluctuations in 
miner incentives and network security. That is, in the event of a halving, any yield that block validators may 
eventually receive would half as well, making the validator activity less attractive, and introducing the potential 
risk of a simultaneous exit of a big percentage of the block validators, which may jeopardize the security of the 
network.

Moreover, the inflation rate in a halving model like this approaches zero asymptotically over time. This is clearly 
undesirable in the context of Proof of Stake, as the rewards that block validators can expect also approaches zero. 
Because Proof of Stake requires no specialized hardware, validators find a very low barrier in withdrawing their 
stake and relocating their funds into a different protocol that may allow them to earn more attractive rewards. 
In other words, a Proof of Stake network and its security can only be sustainable if the inflation is guaranteed to 
never go below a certain threshold, which in its simplest form translates to making the block rewards grow linearly
with the total supply of the coin in which the rewards are denominated.

At the same time, while the 45-block time introduced by [WIP-0003] has been proven to be sufficient for allowing the 
network to propagate protocol messages and maintain consensus effectively, there has been a constant demand from the 
users of the oracle for shorter latency.

Because the transactions that are involved in the process of commitment, reveal and tally of oracle queries require
confirmation by inclusion in a block, in the best scenario, the time-to-resolution of an oracle query can be no less 
than the time that it takes to append 4 blocks to the tip of the chain (1 for publishing the query itself, 1 for 
commitments, 1 for reveals, and finally 1 for the tally).

With a block time of 45 seconds, those 4 blocks equal to 3 minutes. While this latency may be perfectly fine for many
use cases, there are some of those in which the freshness of the data being attested is key. Any reduction to this 
latency—even if marginal—can make a big difference to them.

### Considered and alternative solutions

[WIP-0003] itself explores several alternative coin emission schedules. However, they are all based on the same 
Bitcoin-like model with asymptotic inflation and halvings.

The discussion on improving the coin emission schedule has been going on for many years, but the matter started to 
receive more attention as soon as Proof of Stake started to shape up as the consensus algorithm for Wit/2.

Over the years, other proposals like reducing the block rewards in shorter periods and milder installments have been 
brought to the table, but the issue of the asymptotic convergence to zero of the inflation was not addressed by 
them.

During the process of drafting this document, several issuance schedules focusing on modulating and eventually fixing
the inflation instead of the quantity of the block rewards were explored. These looked very promising for 
fulfilling the goal of long term sustainability. However, we found that the balance between providing attractive 
incentives for validators and keeping the total coin supply contained needs to be adjusted very carefully. Therefore,
we reached the conclusion that an eventual transition to a fixed inflation schedule—while still strictly needed—will 
require further examination of the reality of the network and the distribution of stake once Wit/2 has been running 
for a while.

On the subject of the block time, aka _epoch period_, several past and recent experiments performed by node operators
and relevant contributors to the design and development of the protocol have shown that a block time shorter than 15
seconds could jeopardize the stability of the network, but a 20-30 seconds block time allows the protocol to perform 
just as well as with the current 45 seconds block time.

## Specification

### Calculation of block rewards

**(1)** The block reward MUST NOT be calculated any longer using the old function that computed it for every block 
based on an initial reward, the current protocol epoch, and a halving period.

**(2)** The block reward MUST be fixed to `50` Wit.

### Reduction of the epochs period

**(3)** The epochs period MUST be `20` seconds. That is, a protocol checkpoint MUST happen every `20` seconds.

**(4)** The superblock period MUST be `200` seconds. That is, it remains stable at `10` epochs.

**(5)** All other sub-epoch and super-epoch constants found in an implementation of the protocol MUST be updated 
in the same way so that they are adjusted proportionally.

**(6)** All the scheduled halvings of block rewards MUST be cancelled.

### Confirmation or revocation of these changes

**(7)** Within 1 year from the entry into force of these changes, a subsequent Witnet Improvement Proposal MUST be 
published, such that it MUST enact one of the following rules:

1. Introduction of a coin issuance schedule that has a fixed inflation in the long term.
2. Introduction of a different coin issuance schedule without a fixed inflation in the long term, in which case 
   abundant evidence of the suitability and superiority of such approach MUST be provided. 
3. Extension of the period for enactment of rules 1 or 2 above for a maximum period of 1 year, in which case, this same 
   rule 3 MAY be inherited by the subsequent Proposal.

## Backwards compatibility

### Consensus cheat sheet

Upon entry into force of the proposed improvements:

- Blocks and transactions that were considered valid by former versions of the protocol MUST continue to be considered
- valid.
- Blocks and transactions produced by non-implementers MUST be validated by implementers using the same rules as with
- those coming from implementers, that is, the new rules.
- Implementers MUST apply the proposed logic when assessing the right time for proposing or validating blocks, 
  computing their own eligibility for proposing blocks or witnessing data requests, as well as any other operation 
  related to the protocol or its implementation details that may rely on timely completion or delivery within the 
  duration of one or more epochs or super-epoch windows.

As a result:

- Non-implementers MAY NOT get their blocks and transactions accepted by implementers due to mismatching epoch 
  numbers, inappropriate timing of their protocol messages, and other reasons.
- Implementers MAY NOT get their valid blocks accepted by non-implementers for the very same reasons.
- Non-implementers MAY consolidate different blocks and superblocks than implementers.

Due to all these points, this MUST be considered a consensus-critical protocol improvement. An adoption plan MUST be
proposed, setting an activation date that gives miners enough time in advance to upgrade their existing clients.

### Libraries, clients, and interfaces

The protocol improvements proposed herein will affect any library or client implementing the core Witnet block chain
protocol, especially the validation rules for block or superblock eligibility, as well as commitment, reveal and 
tally transactions.

Libraries, clients, interfaces, APIs, or any other software or hardware that do not validate block candidates, 
superblock votes, commitment, reveal or tally transactions in real time may remain unaffected for the most part.

## Reference Implementation

These changes have been implemented in commit [85cad57913f578e6aa2809db61e7b634c5b72f2a][implementation].

## Adoption Plan

This improvements are bound to get activated jointly with those proposed in [WIP-0028]. That is:

- The activation of the intermediary `V1_8` protocol is proposed for February 18 2025 at 9am UTC, that is, namely at 
  protocol epoch `#3048960`.
- The activation of the final `V2_0` protocol is delayed 1 week (`13_440` protocol epochs) from the first epoch in 
  which at least `300_000_000` Wit have been staked after the activation of the `V1_8` protocol.
