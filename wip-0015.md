## Abstract

This proposal aims to amend the data request weight specification (described in the WIP-0007) to match the current implementation in `witnet-rust`.


## Motivation and rationale

The implementation of the data request transaction weight formula, included in the pull request [witnet-rust#1301], differed from what was previously specified in the [WIP-0007].

The transaction weight formulae are considered consensus critical as they are also used to determine if a block is valid by checking if the aggregated transaction weights exceed or not a certain value, known as bucket size. Therefore, to guarantee interoperability with other Witnet nodes, it is paramount that the specification from the [WIP-0007] and the `witnet-rust` reference implementation should be the same.


### Current reference implementation vs. specification

The reference implementation in `witnet-rust` differed from the specification of the [WIP-0007] because it is applying the factor `alpha` to all the components of the formula as:

```
DR_weight = DR_OUTPUT_size*alpha + W*COMMIT + W*REVEAL*beta + TALLY*beta + W*OUTPUT_SIZE + (N*INPUT_SIZE + M*OUTPUT_SIZE)*alpha
```

However, the [WIP-0007] defines the data request weight as:

```
DR_weight = DR_size*alpha + W*COMMIT + W*REVEAL*beta + TALLY*beta + W*OUTPUT_SIZE
```

The main differences between both equations are:
 1. the [WIP-0007] is heavily subsidizing "join transactions" by neglecting the size of the transaction input components.
 2. the [WIP-0007] neglects `OUTPUT_SIZE` components as they have fixed sized (i.e. data requests can only have 0 or 1 output components).
 3. the `witnet-rust` reference implementation was wrongly using the factor `alpha`, which currently is harmless because `alpha=1`.
 4. the `witnet-rust` reference implementation takes into account the sizes of the input and output components.


The heavy subsidy towards join transactions poses, however, an availability threat that may affect the network stability. It also enables [Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks][DoS] because malicious users may create large data requests with many input components to create large blocks that cannot be propagated fast enough within an epoch (45 seconds).


## Specification

This document proposes to update the data request weight definition as:

```
DR_weight = DR_OUTPUT_size*alpha + W*COMMIT + W*REVEAL*beta + TALLY*beta + (W+M)*OUTPUT_SIZE + N*INPUT_SIZE
```

The underlying reasons for the update are:

 - It does not affect the current `witnet-rust` implementation as `alpha=1`.
 - The updated formula takes into consideration the input and output components, thus reducing the attack surface, especially against [DoS].


### Amend WIP-0007 to match the reference implementation

**(1)** Update the data request weight definition in [WIP-0007] above specified.


### Update `witnet-rust` reference implementation logic

**(2)** Update the `witnet-rust` implementation by removing the factor `alpha` from the last element of the sum (i.e. `(N*INPUT_SIZE + M*OUTPUT_SIZE)`).


## Backwards compatibility


### Consensus

This proposal introduces an update in the data request weight computation, which can be considered a consensus critical change. However, due to the use of a factor equalized to the unit, the values extracted by applying the previous and the updated formula will be the same.

Therefore, there is enough evidence to assert that for the currently used parameters, this amendment can be considered backward compatible with nodes running the `witnet-rust` reference implementation.


### Libraries and Clients

Known libraries and clients are based on the `witnet-rust` reference implementation and, therefore, this amendment should not affect them.


## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation for the proposed protocol improvement can be found as a [pull request in the
witnet-rust repository][witnet-rust#1966].


## Adoption Plan

An adoption plan is not needed.
